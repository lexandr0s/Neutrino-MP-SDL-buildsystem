How to bootstrap your system using OPK packages
===============================================

Prepare everything:
* make preqs
* make crosstool
* make bootstrap

Build minimal system root tarball:
* make minimal-system-pkgs
After this finishes, you will have a tarball in build_tmp named
min-root-$(PLATFORM).tar.gz

Unpack this tarball onto an empty partition on your box and boot
from it.

Build packages for a more complete system:
* make system-pkgs

Now copy pkgs/opkg onto a Server, adjust /etc/opkg/opkg.conf on the box.
Then, on the box:
  opkg-cl update
  opkg-cl install neutrino-hd

(see README.packages for more info on how to configure your server)
