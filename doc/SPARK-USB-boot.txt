SPARK usb-boot HOWTO:

create a U-Boot autoscript that can boot from USB
the USB stick needs 2 partitions:
 * sda1: fat with the kernel uImage and script.img
 * sda2: ext2 with the target partition

The easiest way to create the files for the two partitions
is to do "make spark-system-usb". This sould give you two
tarballs in build_tmp/sparksystem:

  ~> ls -1 build_tmp/sparksystem/*gz
  build_tmp/sparksystem/p1.tar.gz
  build_tmp/sparksystem/p2.tar.gz

Unpack p1.tar.gz into the FAT partition and p2.tar.gz into the
ext2 partition. Unmount both partitions, unplug the stick.

Plug the stick into the box.

Now change your bootargs in U-boot like the following:

* first copy your original bootcmd:
  MB618> setenv bootcmd_fromflash ${bootcmd}
  MB618> saveenv

* then set the new bootcmd:
  MB618> setenv bootcmd usb start\;fatload usb 0 81000000 script.img\;autoscr 81000000\;run bootcmd_fromflash

* do not yet saveenv! first boot once manually without a plugged
  USB stick to verify the fallback:

  MB618> boot

  the box now must boot the previously configured image.

* if this works, reboot into u-boot, attach the USB stick,
  MB618> setenv bootcmd usb start\;fatload usb 0 81000000 script.img\;autoscr 81000000\;run bootcmd_fromflash
  MB618> boot

  now it should boot from the USB stick.

* If this worked as well, go back into U-boot, change the bootargs
  and this time "saveenv" the new bootcmd.

Even after changing the bootargs, if you unplug your stick
from the box, the box will boot normally, so this should
be harmless and convenient.

Use at your own risk, though :-)

Have a lot of fun...
