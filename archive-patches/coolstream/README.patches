archive-patches/coolstream/*:

These are the patches of libs checked into the coolstream svn vs. the
native tarballs as downloaded from the respective projects.

These patches are mainly for information purposes as they contain lots
of noise due to pointless addition of autoconf output etc :-(

Still they might be useful to find out what is actually different to
upstream.
